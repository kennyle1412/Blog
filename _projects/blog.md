**Overview**
====
This was a blog I created for fun and to host my portfolio.
While it wasn't my first time working with HTML and CSS, it was my first time learning about Jekyll.
I enjoyed the simplicity of a static site with a base to work with instead of creating everything through scratch.
It's main focus will be on science and technology, computer science, and programming.
Though I'll try to have a **weekly thoughts** section every Sunday to lay out my thoughts on some medium and keep myself dedicated.

**Design**
===
This blog is built on top of the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and replaces the header with a sidebar.
While I was originally going to keep the minima theme as it is, it didn't really fit the image I was looking for.
Additionally, adding the sidebar allows people to keep the all the categories of the site available without having to scroll all the way back to the top again.

I chose to keep the footer in the blog even though it has some redundant information such as socials or site description.
I felt it added a sense of completeness to the blog where it would have too much emptiness without it.

**Mobile**
===
The mobile site retains the original minima theme as sidebar doesn't really work on such a small screen.
The categories become the hamburger bar anyways so there's always a way to access the other parts of the site.
Though the title bar had it's colors inverted to black background / white foreground as even the smallest contrast makes a big difference to the overall feel.
