Don't really know jekyll, only ever used react before. New experience.
Really wanted a sidebar, but didn't know how to do that. 
Had to experiment and saw github: poole/lanyon and really liked the theme.
However, while the theme was nice, I wanted to try and customize my own.
Though it's built on top of minima, it was a great learning experience to learn more about html and css.
