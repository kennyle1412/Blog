**Overview**
====
This was a blog I created for fun and to host my portfolio.
While it wasn't my first time working with HTML and CSS, it was my first time learning about Jekyll.
I enjoyed the simplicity of a static site without really having to worry about a complicated backend to build upon.

**Design**
===
This blog is built on top of the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and replaces the header with a sidebar.
While I was originally going to keep the minima theme as it is, it was **too** minimal for my tastes (though that's what it was designed to be).
Adding a little color and allowing the content to be the main focus and filling up the entire page top - down.

I chose to keep the footer in the blog even though it has some redundant information such as socials or site description.
I felt it added a sense of completeness to the blog where it would have too much emptiness without it.
Then again, I'm not a designer so what do I know.

**Mobile**
===
The mobile site retains the original minima theme as sidebar doesn't really work on such a small screen.
The categories become the hamburger bar anyways so there's always a way to access the other parts of the site.
Though the title bar had it's colors inverted to black background vs. white foreground as even the smallest contrast makes a big difference to the overall feel.
