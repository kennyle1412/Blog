My name is Kenny and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. 

> I studied Computer Science for almost 7 years now. <br/>
> I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2018. <br/>
> I enjoy programming, games, and reading stories. <br/>
> I hate onions.

Now that the generic information is out of the way, I created this blog mostly to entertain myself and keep a record of things that I've learned.
I enjoy learning new things and actually applying that knowledge first hand to create this site was part of that experience.
While this blog wasn't supposed to be anything fancy (it still isn't), it's actually more sophisticated than I intended it to be.

In a way, it represents the person who I am.
Relatively simple, but always willing to improve.
Wow, how cliche right?
Next thing you know, I'll be talking about how I'm a super focused and dedicated person that forgets the passage of time when I'm trying to solve a problem.
Okay, sorry.

Here's a picture of my dog so it's not a total waste of time.
