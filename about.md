My name is Kenny and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer.

> I enjoy programming, exercising, reading, and learning. <br/>
> I hate onions.

Now that the generic information is out of the way, I created this blog mostly to entertain myself and keep a record of things that I've learned.
Though I keep forgetting to update it so there's that.

In a way, it represents the person who I am.
Relatively simple, but always willing to improve.
Wow, how cliche right?
Next thing you know, I'll be talking about how I'm a super focused and dedicated person that doesn't notice the passage of time when I'm trying to solve a problem.
Okay, sorry.

Here's a picture of my dog.
