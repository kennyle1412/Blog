Wow, how basic. What an introduction. Something that can be found on countless other **about me** pages and intro briefs.
And that's understandable because talking about yourself is (in my opinion) is one of the easiest, yet also hardest things to do.
In a way, it's like making a speech in front of an audience. 
It can be easy, or it can be hard.
Depending on the person and what they have to say.

How do you avoid sounding formulaic when following the general outline of: accomplishments, hobbies, likes, and dislikes is what makes up a person? 
Even I'm writing all these words because I'm not really sure what to say.
I like sounding philosophical though and what I'm saying makes sense to me.
I even meditated a bit just to decide what to say too.
But this is also a part of who I am and I accept that.

Everything I put on this blog is me.
