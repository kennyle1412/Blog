So, when I started this blog, it was before I got started working on another project.
I was really gung-ho about getting everything complete and making regular posts.
However, life does know how to get a kick at you.

I've recently been looking at some open source projects the past couple weeks and I found [code sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) for [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VSCode + Vim is my favorite text editor and syncing across systems is quite the pain. When there was a feature request to implement a git syncing I decided I would go for it.

Anyways, I've spent most of the past 2 weeks doing that, and now it's time to gradually integrate the changes so it doesn't break anything. I'll probably make a project post when it's finally done.

Everything's a Work in Progress.

P.S. Though I've also decided to pick up the book [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) to start reading in order to up my game. It's one of the most recommended books out there so we'll see how it goes.
