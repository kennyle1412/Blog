Today, I've started making the transition from vim to emacs.
Though going through the process of installing stuff on Emacs actually made me want to become evil.
Though half the problem might have been because I was trying to work it through Windows.

I first became interested in emacs after watching this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc)
and everything just escalated from there.

The first step was to port over some key bindings.
An initial search gave some

[another one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10569165/how-to-map-jj-to-esc-in-emacs-evil-mode).
However, that also came with some
[problems](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/19961/using-jk-to-exit-insert-mode-with-key-chord-or-anything-else/20024#20024).
