title: Becoming Evil
tags: [emacs, vim]

Today, I've started making the transition from vim to emacs.

However, half the problem might have been because I was trying to work it through Windows.

I first became interested in emacs after watching this

and while I admit I didn't get through it all, it made me wanna try it out.

The first step was to actually download Emacs. While I'm sure it's 1000x easier on Unix systems, 
An initial search gave some

However, that also came with some
