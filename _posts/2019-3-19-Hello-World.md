Over the years since I've been studying Computer Science, I've learned a lot of things but also realized that I still don't know anything.
The field is too massive to know everything, but you can learn something new everyday.
Learning doesn't happen in school, but throughout a person's entire life.

![I feel like I'm forgetting something...](/assets/images/forget.png "Like my chips.")

However, forgetting those bits and pieces over the years is a sad thing.
Since I started on this path 7 years ago, I can only really remember those fustrating or celebratory moments that sticks with you. 
Everything else feels like they're leaves in the wind. 
Sometimes they're there, most of the time they're not.

I distinctly remember trying to set up an executable in Java when everything was just starting, because I wanted to stop opening up JCreator just to run a java file.
While I can recall finally succeeding and somewhat learning how to use the command line, it's only what I can remember from my inherently fallible memory.
I don't want to someday forget the experience ever existed.

So I'm creating this blog to keep a record of what I've learned and to make sure I don't forget my progress as I study more and improve myself.
It'll also serve to improve my writing skills that will hopefully get better in time and I won't sound like chalk against the wall and bore people to death.

I wish I started this blog before I went to college so I could've kept track of all my experience, but hindsight is 20/20 and it's never too late to start.
